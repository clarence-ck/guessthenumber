# 终极密码

终极密码 is created through my own self learning in Microsoft Learn Python. Basically took snippets of the code that are useful in the courses, then add in codes to build the 终极密码
game.

The features of 终极密码 include, enter a name of the dealer, anonymous name is fine, restrict integers to be keyed in from 1 - 100, reduction of avaiable numbers in the range 
gradually till the correct one is left. The last feature is completely self developed by my own efforts.

终极密码 is often played in variety show in Taiwan. It is a simple yet entertaining game, whereby the person who guess correctly, or the last person left with the chose number
does a forfeit on the show. Sometimes the host of the show will deliberately change the chosen number to get the person do the forfeit.

Game is start by chosing one random number from 1-100. The number is only known by the dealer.
Each player takes turn to guess till one guess it right. The player who guess it right is the joker and does the forfeit. 
In the instance when two numbers are left, the player in turn still guessed the wrong number, the next player in line strikes
the jackpot and is the joker!


 终极密码 2 Players allows two players to register. Same concept but added in another while loop to run the game.
 
 If there are 3 players or more best to use 终极密码. For two players 终极密码 2 Players is the suitable one.
